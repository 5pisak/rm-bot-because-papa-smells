**Note**: this module uses recent discordjs features and requires discord.js version 12.

Music Player by Akumiś is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module that allows you to easily make Discord Music Bot with commands. You can customize **everything**, and everything is done to simplify your work **without limiting you!** Because it uses **scraping**, it doesn't require any API key!

```

```sh
npm install --save @discordjs/opus
```

## Features

1. Not complicated!
2. A lot of commands to manage music!
3. Free to use and edit!

## Getting Started

Here is the code you will need to get started with discord-player. Then, you will be able to use `client.player` everywhere in your code!

```js
const Discord = require("discord.js"),
client = new Discord.Client(),
settings = {
    prefix: "!",
    token: "Your Discord Token"
};

const { Player } = require("music-player-akumis");
const player = new Player(client);

client.player = player;

client.player.on('trackStart', (message, track) => message.channel.send(`Now playing ${track.title}...`))
client.on("ready", () => {
    console.log("I'm ready !");
});

client.on("message", async (message) => {
    const args = message.content.slice(settings.prefix.length).trim().split(/ +/g);
    const command = args.shift().toLowerCase();
    if(command === "play"){
        client.player.play(message, args[0]);
    }
});

client.login(settings.token);
```



### Methods overview

You need to **init the guild queue using the play() function**, then you are able to manage the queue and the music using the following functions. Click on a function name to get an example code and explanations.

#### Play a track

* [play(message, query)]() - play a track in a server 

#### Check if a track is being played

* [isPlaying(message)]() - check if there is a queue for a specific server

#### Manage the queue

* [getQueue(message)]() - get the server queue
* [clearQueue(message)]() - clear the server queue
* [remove(message, track)]() - remove a track from the server queue
* [nowPlaying(message)]() - get the current track

#### Manage music stream

* [skip(message)]() - skip the current track
* [back(message)]() - play the previous track
* [pause(message)]() - pause the current track
* [resume(message)]() - resume the current track
* [stop(message)]() - stop the current track
* [setFilters(message, newFilters)]() - update filters (bassboost for example)
* [setRepeatMode(message, boolean)]() - enable or disable repeat mode for the server (play the song again and again)
* [setLoopMode(message, boolean)]() - enable or disable loop mode for the server (play the queue again and again)

### Event messages

```js
// Then add some messages that will be sent when the events will be triggered
client.player

// Send a message when a track starts
.on('trackStart', (message, track) => message.channel.send(`Now playing ${track.title}...`))

// Send a message when something is added to the queue
.on('trackAdd', (message, queue, track) => message.channel.send(`${track.title} has been added to the queue!`))
.on('playlistAdd', (message, queue, playlist) => message.channel.send(`${playlist.title} has been added to the queue (${playlist.tracks.length} songs)!`))

// Send messages to format search results
.on('searchResults', (message, query, tracks) => {

    const embed = new Discord.MessageEmbed()
    .setAuthor(`Here are your search results for ${query}!`)
    .setDescription(tracks.map((t, i) => `${i}. ${t.title}`))
    .setFooter('Send the number of the song you want to play!')
    message.channel.send(embed);

})
.on('searchInvalidResponse', (message, query, tracks, content, collector) => {

    if (content === 'cancel') {
        collector.stop()
        return message.channel.send('Search cancelled!')
    }

    message.channel.send(`You must send a valid number between 1 and ${tracks.length}!`)

})
.on('searchCancel', (message, query, tracks) => message.channel.send('You did not provide a valid response... Please send the command again!'))
.on('noResults', (message, query) => message.channel.send(`No results found on YouTube for ${query}!`))

// Send a message when the music is stopped
.on('queueEnd', (message, queue) => message.channel.send('Music stopped as there is no more music in the queue!'))
.on('channelEmpty', (message, queue) => message.channel.send('Music stopped as there is no more member in the voice channel!'))
.on('botDisconnect', (message) => message.channel.send('Music stopped as I have been disconnected from the channel!'))

// Error handling
.on('error', (error, message) => {
    switch(error){
        case 'NotPlaying':
            message.channel.send('There is no music being played on this server!')
            break;
        case 'NotConnected':
            message.channel.send('You are not connected in any voice channel!')
            break;
        case 'UnableToJoin':
            message.channel.send('I am not able to join your voice channel, please check my permissions!')
            break;
        case 'LiveVideo':
            message.channel.send('YouTube lives are not supported!')
            break;
